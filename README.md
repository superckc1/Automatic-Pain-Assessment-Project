This repository contains the code and datasets used for my master's thesis, titled "Exploring Novel Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic Pain Assessment". The study focuses on applying deep learning models such as ResNet50 and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for pain level estimation from facial expression images. Traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) are used as baselines for comparison.
